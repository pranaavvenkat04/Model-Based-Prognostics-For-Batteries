# Model-Based Prognostics For Batteries 

## Description
- Skills: Project Management · Python · Linux · Raspberry Pi · HTML5 · CSS

- A NASA prototype software solution that predicts the remaining useful life of an object in use. It develops a mathematical model to describe battery behavior during individual discharge cycles as well as over its cycle life. The models used to estimate the remaining useful life of batteries are linked to the internal electro-chemical processes of the battery.
- Collaborated with the mechanical & electrical engineering team to create a system that measures voltages from a battery and compares the data against a custom-made mathematical model
